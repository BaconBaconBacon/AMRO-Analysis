# Data

Storage for AMRO measurement data at various processing stages.

## Directory Structure

### `raw/`

**Input**: Unprocessed data files directly from the lab instrument.

- Source: QD USA PPMS ACT (AC Transport) Option
- Format: `.dat` or `.csv` files with header metadata
- Contents: Temperature, magnetic field, sample angle, and resistance measurements
- Note: Includes both +H and -H field measurements (before anti-symmetrization)

### `processed/`

**Intermediate**: Cleaned and anti-symmetrized AMRO data.

- Generated by: `scripts/run_cleaner.py`
- Format: CSV files with standardized column headers
- Contents: Anti-symmetrized resistivity vs angle for each (T, H) condition
- Naming: `{experiment_label}_cleaned.csv`

### `final/`

**Output**: Analysis results ready for presentation.

- Generated by: `scripts/run_pipeline.py` or notebook analysis
- Contents:
  - `{project_name}.pkl`: Pickled ProjectData object (full analysis state)
  - `{project_name}_fourier_results.csv`: Fourier transform components
  - `{project_name}_fit_results_{params}.csv`: Fit parameters and statistics

## Notes

- Data files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Sample data can be regenerated by running the processing scripts
- Pickle files preserve the complete analysis state for quick reloading
